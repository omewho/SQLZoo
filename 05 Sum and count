####


Counting big countries in each continent
7. For each continent show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million.

####


Counting big continents
8. List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.
####
select continent
from world
group by continent
having sum(population) >= 100000000
####





Using GROUP BY and HAVING.
1.For each continent show the number of countries:

world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)
####
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
####


2.For each continent show the total population:
####
select continent, sum(population)
from world
group by continent
####


3.
WHERE and GROUP BY. The WHERE filter takes place before the aggregating function. 
For each relevant continent show the number of countries that has a population of at least 200000000.
####
select continent, count(name)
from world
where population >= 200000000
group by continent
####


4.
GROUP BY and HAVING. The HAVING clause is tested after the GROUP BY. 
You can test the aggregated values with a HAVING clause. 
Show the total population of those continents with a total population of at least half a billion.
####
select continent, sum(population)
from world
group by continent
having sum(population) >= 500000000
####
